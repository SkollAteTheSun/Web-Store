# Web-Store

The application is built according to the Model-View-Controller pattern. 
To work with the database, use Entity Framework. For a more pleasant perception, a Bootstrap.js is used.

The store consists of several pages on which are located:
* all cars;
* only petrol;
* only electric;
* the best choice;
* user basket;
* order form.

The web application allows you to add a product to the cart and create a user's cart.

After the basket is formed, it is possible to fill out a purchase request, which is stored in the database.
