# Web-Store

ASP.NET.Core + Bootstrap

The store consists of several pages on which are located:
* all cars;
* only petrol;
* only electric;
* the best choice;
* user basket;
* purchase order form.

The web application allows you to add a product to the cart and create a user's cart.

After the basket is formed, it is possible to fill out a purchase request, which is stored in the database.
